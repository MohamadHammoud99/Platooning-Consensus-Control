# Platooning-Consensus-Control

- Advanced Control Methods for Dynamic Systems 
- Team of 4 students

•	In this project, we have five robots (in the XY plane) whose speed we can directly control.

•	They have been placed in a proposed initial position and must maintain a linear formation to a destination position that can be changed.

•	The model used is the kinematic bicycle model.

•	We take 2 cases: first, the robots communicate with each other, second, we propose a simplified graph with minimal communication between the robots.

•	Then, the robots converge (position and formation convergence) to their desired positions (X-axis platoon). After arriving at the desired destinations, it is desired to control the robots so that they continue to move vertically while maintaining the same inter-distance.

•	In each case, we try to modify (tune) the hyperparameters (alpha and lambda) to analyze the results.

•	Output of the project: 
  o	MATLAB/ Simulink file
  o	Report (personal interpretation).

•	Skills token from this project:
  -	MATLAB/Simulink
  -	Consensus control law, graph of communication
  -	Analyzing results (manual tuning of the hyperparameters)
